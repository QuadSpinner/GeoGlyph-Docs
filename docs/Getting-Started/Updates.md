## Improving GeoGlyph
We are committed to improving GeoGlyph 2, and, as such, will release updates every once in a while. Updates are optional, and initiated only with your direct permission. You can choose to skip one or more updates. We provide detailed information for each update so you can see whether the improvements and bug fixes in each individual update are of interest to you.

## Types of Updates
- **Major Update** - This is an integral update that will generally add new features and large scale improvements. Such updates should not be skipped unless absolutely necessary.
- **Minor Update** - This is an update with low impact generally covering bug fixes or addressing a broken feature.
- **Hotfix** - This is an emergency update that fixes a critical bug. This usually has no negative impact on existing projects, and as such can be applied anytime. 

## Initiating an update

### Automatic Update
When an internet connection is available, GeoGlyph will notify you of updates on the **Startup Screen**.

Click the **Update available** button to see the changelog and start the download.

Once downloaded, GeoGlyph will launch the update's installer. See [Installation] for instructions on installing.

Updates are stored in `C:\Users\You\AppData\Roaming\QuadSpinner\GeoGlyph\Updates\`. You can archive them if necessary. They can also be redownloaded from the website.

### Manual Update
Manually updating GeoGlyph is the same as [installing a new copy](Getting-Started--Installation).

1. Sign into your account on the [QuadSpinner Store](http://store.quadspinner.com).
1. Download the latest build. This is an MSI file *GeoGlyph_2.0.xxx.yyy.msi* (where xxx.yyy is a version number).
1. Download your license key if you have purchased GeoGlyph.
