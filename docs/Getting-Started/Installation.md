## Prerequisites

- World Machine 64-bit Standard or Professional (2.3.7, 2.9.0.7, 3.0.0.3, 3.0.0.11)
- Windows 7 or higher
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1 or higher
- Latest Drivers for CPU and GPU to utilize OpenCL

## Installation

1. Ensure World Machine is not running. If GeoGlyph 1.0 was installed, please uninstall it first.
2. Download ```GeoGlyph_2.0.xxx.yyy.msi``` (where xxx.yyy is a version number) and run the MSI file. This download can be found in 'My Account' on QuadSpinner.com.
3. Setup will attempt to automatically detect the locations of the World Machine installation(s), as well as the World Machine Documents and Macro paths. Check to see if the paths are accurate. If not, you may need to choose them manually. See below for help with the paths.
4. Choose the components you wish to install. In most cases, the default selection is recommended. You can also review the destination paths and modify them as needed.
5. Proceed with installation.
6. Once installation is complete, run GeoGlyph 2 from the Start Menu or Desktop.

## Paths
- World Machine 2.3.7 and 2.9.0.7 are typically installed in ```C:\Program Files (x86)\World Machine 2 Professional\```
- World Machine 3.0.x builds are typically installed in ```C:\Program Files (x86)\World Machine Professional Edition Development Version```
- World Machine Documents are typically installed in ```C:\Users\[YOU]\Documents\World Machine Documents```
- World Machine Macros are typically installed in ```C:\Users\[YOU]\Documents\World Machine Documents\Macros```. 

[!IMPORTANT]

Sometimes Macros may be installed to ```C:\Program Files (x86)\World Machine 2 Professional\Macros\```. If so, you will need to change it to the path above, or any other user-writable path that as no read/write restrictions. To change the path, go to ```World Commands menu > Preferences > Paths``` in World Machine.

[IMPORTANT!]

## Compatibility with GeoGlyph 1.0

Please see [this link](6666) for information on how to use GeoGlyph 1.0 macros in GeoGlyph 2.0. Ideally, you should [uninstall GeoGlyph 1.4 from the GeoGlyph Manager](6666) before installing GeoGlyph 2.0.
