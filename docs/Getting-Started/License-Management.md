GeoGlyph 2.0 features a flexible, hassle-free licensing system. It is no longer node-locked and can be installed on two computers, as long as you are the only user. It also does not differentiate betweek "home" and "work", as well as geographic restrictions.

## Authorize your copy

1. Sign into your account on the [QuadSpinner Store](http://store.quadspinner.com).
1. Download your license key using the **Key** link in your Downloads area.
1. Open GeoGlyph, and open the menu item **Manage License**. This can be access from the **GeoGlyph Startup Screen menu** or from the **+GeoGlyph** menu in the IDE.
1. Click **Load License** and select the `JohnDoe_Indie_1234.gg2` key file.
1. GeoGlyph will be instantly authorized.

[!NOTE]
GeoGlyph 2.0 does not use .txt files for licenses like GeoGlyph 1.0. The new format is `.GG2`. The key filename is typically `YourName_Edition_ID.gg2`.
[NOTE!] 

## Deauthorizing your copy
GeoGylph 2.0 can be installed on 2 different machines. If you face a hardware change, or need to install on a new computer, you will first need to deauthorize one of the other installations.

To deauthorize a copy:
1. Open GeoGlyph, and open the menu item **Manage License**. This can be access from the **GeoGlyph Startup Screen menu** or from the **+GeoGlyph** menu in the IDE.
1. Click **Deactivate**.
1. GeoGlyph will create a copy of the deactivation record on your desktop, called *GeoGlyph_Deactivation.txt*.

It is generally recommended to keep a copy of the Deactivation Record in case of license mismatch or other issues with authorization in the future.  

[!CAUTION]

If a third installation is activated without deauthorizing one of the previous installations, GeoGlyph will automatically deauthorize the oldest installation to free up an install slot for the new installation.
