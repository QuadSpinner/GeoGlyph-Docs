## Interface
GeoGlyph 2.0 marks a dramatic improvement over the interface enhancements in GeoGlyph 1.0. The new Integrated Design Environment, or IDE, is available as a complete UI overhaul for World Machine, or in the lightweight Hosted mode.

For more details, see [Introduction to the IDE](IDE--Introduction-to-the-IDE).

## Devices
GeoGlyph 2.0 uses its own terrain engine to create and modify terrains. Several dozen new devices powered by this engine are available in this version, including six new forms of erosion.

See the [Devices](Devices--Apex) section for more information.

## Color Production
The new @GeoColor device takes color production to new levels with texture generation from photos and concept art, as well as a modern gradient editor.

See [Color Production Tools](IDE--Color-Production-Tools)
