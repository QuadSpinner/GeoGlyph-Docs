## Launching GeoGlyph + World Machine

> Starting and using GeoGlyph 2 is quite different from GeoGlyph 1. Instead of starting World Machine first, and then launching WM Toolbox, now you start GeoGlyph 2 from the Start Menu and it will start World Machine for you.

> Always start GeoGlyph 2, not World Machine. If you want to familiar World Machine feel, you can always choose the **Hosted Mode** on the startup screen.

> This is important as GeoGlyph 2's Integrated Development Environment (IDE) wraps itself around World Machine and connects deeply with it, like a suit of power armor. To enable this, GeoGlyph must be launched first, otherwise new functionality might be limited.

> All GeoGlyph-specific functionality is exposed through the **GeoGlyph** menu and the special toolbar available in the far right of the main toolbar.

## Creating Devices

> The new GeoGlyph IDE gives you 3 methods to access devices and macros:
> 1. The enhanced Toolbar with powerful searching and popup Toolbox.
> 2. The Toolbox sidebar, which can be toggled from the GeoGlyph menu or the GeoGlyph toolbar.
> 3. The Create and GeoGlyph menus.

## Building

> GeoGlyph 2 introduces the **Build Stack**. To have your build included in the Build Stack, you must be build your TMD file using the **Build All (Purple)** and **Build To Current (Green)** build buttons in the **GeoGlyph Toolbar**.
