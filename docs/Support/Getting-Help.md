## Feedback Dialog
The Feedback dialog is the most efficient and convenient way to get help - especially with a technical problem. When you use this dialog, we get your comments and questions along with vital diagnostics data that helps us analyze what went wrong or if something in the installation is damaged.

See [Feedback](IDE--Feedback).

## Generate Diagnostics Log
This menu command creates the exact same Diagnostics Log as the Feedback Dialog, but it does not send it to us directly. With this option, it generates a .zip file with contents of the diagnostics log.

This log can be sent to us by email, our [Uservoice](http://quadspinner.uservoice.com), or any contact form on the website, the Help Sidebar, or even this manual.

## Contact Form
You can use the contact form below to get in touch with us. If you have a Diagnostics Log, you can also attach it in the form below.
