Swirl creates a vortex warp on the terrain. It can be very useful for adding a bit of fluidity to the terrain.

## Properties

- **Strength**: The strength of the vortex. Negative values move the distortion clockwise, while positive values move the distortion counter-clockwise.
- **Scale**: The size of the swirl.
- **X/Y**: The location of the Swirl center. Can be used only if the Scale is less than 1.0.
- **10x**: When activated, the Strength is multiplied by 10.

[!TIP]
Use multiple small amount Swirls with variable scales at different locations to add fluid movement to your terrains.
