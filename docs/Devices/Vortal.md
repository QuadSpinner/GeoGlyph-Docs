Vortal is an advanced form of Hydro erosion. It simulates the same churning forces, but provides control over direction and intensity of both forces. By changing the directionality of the forces and the subsequent churn, you can create complex effects by partially eroding terrains. Vortal is able to recognize large flows such as those created by the Swirl, Whorl, Vortex, and Hydro, thus making it a very useful complement to those devices.

The vortal erosion can be controlled across both sets of forces, allowing you to create a subtle churning effect. Vortal is very useful for water environments as well as desert environments that were shaped underwater millions of years ago (Zion National Park, for example).

## Properties

The following properties are available for both the Macro Force (A) and Micro Force (B).

- **Flow**: Direction of general flow. GeoGlyph will add a 10 degree +/- deviation to the force for visual impact.
- **Churn**: Direction of vorticity. This setting allows you to define an additional direction that can cause vorticity in the flow. At angles just less than perpendicular from the Flow, a definite churning pattern can be achieved.
- **Intensity**: This is the overall intensity (iterations) of the erosive process. Higher values yield better and stronger erosion but sacrifices build speed.

#### Additional Information
A great way to create a river environment is to use RiverErosion on a blurred mask from the River, and then apply Hydro erosion to the bottom half of the mask. A practical example of this can be found in "River + RiverErosion + Hydro.tmd" in the GeoGlyph Examples.
