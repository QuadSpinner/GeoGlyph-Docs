The stark form of erosion is breakage, encapsulated in the form of Stratifier. This erosion method allows you to stratify the terrain in a non-linear fashion. Unlike terracing, Stratification involves substrata/subterraces created in confined local zones such as between two broken plates. Each stratified layer exists independent from the rest of the layer, creating a robust, realistic formation.

## Properties

- **Strength**: The amount of stratification to be applied. Low values produce more strata, with fractured, delicate substrata; high values produce stronger, larger strata.
- **Filtered**: When on, creates smoother curvature for the plates.
- **Compact**: Applies a compact filter to reduce the size of the individual plates.
- **Expand**: Applies an expansion filter to increase the size of the individual plates.

[!TIP]
Apply two different Stratifier erosions to a single terrain: one with very low values, and one with default or slightly higher values. Then combine the two with Average 0.5. This will give you both delicate and larger plates.
