The stark form of erosion is breakage, encapsulated in the form of Stratifier. This erosion method allows you to stratify the terrain in a non-linear fashion. Unlike
terracing, Stratification involves substrata/subterraces created in confined local zones such as between two broken plates. Each stratified layer exists independent from
the rest of the layer, creating a robust, realistic formation.
