Blocky is a unique effect which creates long, vertical platforms on a given noise or terrain. It can be used either as is, or distorted for more prominent effects.

## Properties

- **Curved**: Smooth out the sharp edges of the vertical platforms.
- **Difference**: Output will show only the changes made to the noise, but not the noise itself. This can be useful for usage with combiners.

[!WARNING]

This effect is resolution sensitive and will produce different results at different resolutions.
