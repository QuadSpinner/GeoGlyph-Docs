World Machine 3.0 introduces a new River system that lets you create beautiful winding rivers. RiverErosion further enhances your river creation by providing a different method of eroding rocky river banks, and even underwater areas. While @Hydro uses partially randomized, churning forces to erode the terrain, RiverErosion concentrates on following the flow and creating patterns based on how water flows over and around obstacles.

## Properties

- **Amount**: The amount of erosion. Higher values cause larger, smoother shapes and decay fine details. Lower values preserve details but create slightly rougher curves.
- **Force**: The strength of the flowing water. Higher values erode the rock faster and encourage larger curvature.

[!TIP]
A great way to create a river environment is to use RiverErosion on a blurred mask from the River (WM3 only), and then apply @Hydro erosion to the bottom half of the mask.

[!NOTE]
While RiverErosion works great with World Machine 3.x, it works just as well with World Machine 2.x.
