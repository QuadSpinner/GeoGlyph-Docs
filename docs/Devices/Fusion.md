Fusion is a hybrid of slope erosion, vertical terracing, and thermal erosion. It addresses the challenge of creating interesting slopes in steep areas. Fusion adapts thermal erosion by producing modular talus.

Fusion further adds slanted terracing to convey terrain folding and collapsed plates.

## Properties

- **Talus:** The angle at which erosion should begin.
- **Deviation:** The variation (+/-) to the Talus angle. This is great for creating non-uniform collapsed plates.
- **Iterations:** The number of erosion iterations to perform on the terrain.
- **Seed:** The random seed of the erosion.

[!TIP]
High value Deviation can create very useful slopes upon which you can use snow accumulation devices or macros such as @Blizzard and @Avalanche, or even @SandBlast.

With low value Deviation, @Buildup can also create interesting effects.
