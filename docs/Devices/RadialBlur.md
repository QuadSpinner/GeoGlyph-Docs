RadialBlur works exactly as its sister-effects in Photoshop and other paint programs. It "spins" the terrain creating a whirling effect.

## Properties
- **Amount**: The amount of radial blurring applied to the terrain.

[!TIP]
Using a mask with this effect is highly recommended as the terrain may look unnatural if applied uniformly.
