# SandBlast
##### Device :: Erosion

SandBlast adds windblown sand to a terrain, filling up crevices and creating sand accumulation in all viable areas. As with Buildup, SandBlast adds to the mass of the terrain rather than taking away. SandBlast is similar to the Snow device in World Machine, but works on the principles of sand particle spread rather than precipitation. The sand ignores stark curvatures and accumulates in areas that can provide traction to the sand. When merging sandscapes made with DunesSea, Dunes, and SandStripe macros, with rocky surfaces, processing the end-result with SandBlast provides a natural â€œadhesiveâ€ to realistically combine the two elements.
