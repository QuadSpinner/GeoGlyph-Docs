SandBlast adds windblown sand to a terrain, filling up crevices and creating sand accumulation in all viable areas. As with @Buildup, SandBlast adds to the mass of the terrain rather than taking away. SandBlast is similar to the Snow device in World Machine, but works on the principles of sand particle spread rather than precipitation. The sand ignores stark curvatures and accumulates in areas that can provide traction to the sand. When merging sandscapes made with @DunesSea, @Dunes, and @SandStripe macros, with rocky surfaces, processing the end-result with SandBlast provides a natural â€œadhesiveâ€ to realistically combine the two elements.

## Properties

- **Strength**: The strength of the erosion. Higher values blows more sand in the simulation.
- **Dispersion**: The distance from each accumulation point, up to which the sand should gather. Higher values cause more sand to accumulate.
- **Deposits**: When off, the erosion of blowing sand is applied but sand does not accumulate. When on, the blowing sand is deposited in the crevices and other appropriate locations.
