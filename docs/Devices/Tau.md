Tau creates overlapping terraces with large, rounded corners and gentle slopes. It works great by itself, or when combined with @SandStone or @Stratifier.

## Properties

- **Amount**: Low values produce very fine terraces; high values produce bigger, bulkier terraces.
- **Dispersion**: How far the terrace formations should spread.
