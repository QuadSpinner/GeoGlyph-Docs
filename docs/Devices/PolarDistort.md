The PolarDistort effect creates a kaleidoscope-like effect on a terrain. It can be very useful for creating a distortion that can be merged with the original terrain, or used by itself for a surreal output.

## Properties

- **Amount**: The amount of polar distortion to apply to the terrain. 0.1 is a full, single distortion. Low values produce more repetitions; high values produce fewer repetitions.
