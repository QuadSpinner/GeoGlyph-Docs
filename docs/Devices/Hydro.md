Hydro is a new erosion device that runs on the GeoGlyph Terrain Engine. Hydro works with two sets of forces: the macro force and the micro force, both interweaving to use the shape of the terrain to drive the erosion. This erosion method uses horizontal flow mechanics unlike the vertical sedimentary erosion iconic of World Machine resulting in an output that speaks of flowing waters gently carving the terrain over thousands of year.

## Properties

- **Amount**: The amount of erosion the terrain should undergo. Higher values cause prominent flow structures to be created.
- **Intensity**: The intensity of the erosion. Higher values will cause the erosion to erase smaller features in the terrain by creating stronger flows.

[!TIP]
Do not use higher intensities unless needed. Sometimes, using two or three Hydro devices in a chain with high Amount but low Intensity can create very interesting effects.
