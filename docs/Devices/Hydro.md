Hydro is a new erosion device that runs on the GeoGlyph Terrain Engine. Hydro works with two sets of forces: the macro force and the micro force, both interweaving to use the shape of the terrain to drive the erosion. This erosion method uses horizontal flow mechanics unlike the vertical sedimentary erosion iconic of World Machine resulting in an output that speaks of flowing waters gently carving the terrain over thousands of year.
