Surfacer provides several types of texturing primitives. It should not be used by itself, but rather multiple Surfacers' ouput should be combined to create a sophisticated texture mask, and also combined with other complex texture masks such as those generated by @RealColor, @HeightFrag, and @GeoShape.

## Properties

- **Amount**: The strength of the mask.
- **Output**: Type of output to create.
    - *Sprinkles* - a noisy convexity mask.
    - *Deposits* - a slope deposits mask.
    - *Edges* - an edge mask.
    - *Splotches* - random splotches on the terrain based on the neighboring terrain structures.
    - *Trace* - traces the most prominent shapes on the terrain.
    - *WindStreaks* - masks areas where winds would swipe across structures. Useful for weathering.

[!TIP]
See **GG2-Surfacer-1.tmd** for examples of using Surfacer to create texture masks.
