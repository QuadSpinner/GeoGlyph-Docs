Whorl applies multiple vortex-like distortions across the terrain to create large scale warping. This can be very useful when creating massive landscapes and you wish to avoid a patterning in the noise, or if you want to create slightly surreal or alien landscapes.

## Properties

- **Density**: The number of whorls to add to the terrain.
- **Seed**: The random seed of the effect.

[!TIP]
It is generally recommended that such a powerful warp is added early in the graph, often right after the generator. Further filtering and erosion will then add a higher sense of realism.
