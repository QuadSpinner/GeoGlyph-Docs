CTerrace, or Contoured Terrace, creates strong terracing with a "lip" or raised rim at the outer edge of every terrace.

Unlike traditional terracing, you do not define the number of terraces. The effect figures out how to create a stack of terraces based on the given terrain's features and vertical scale.

## Properties

- **Amount**: The amount of terracing the terrain should undergo. Smaller values produce delicate, and more terraces; larger values produce more pronounced, and thicker terraces.

[!TIP]
CTerrace can be very useful for creating agricultural terraces, mines, and stepped formations.
