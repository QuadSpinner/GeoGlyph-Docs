Pyramids is a distancing device. It uses distance calculation to create strong, linear slopes on a given terrain.

It will find a slope point towards the top (A) of the terrain and draw a linear slope from that point, until it hits the bottom slope (B).

## Properties

- **A / B**: These two properties control the opposing slopes.

[!WARNING]
This settings for this device can be very senstive. They respond better to taller terrains. If you find yourself requiring finer control, apply an Equalizer device before Pyramids and then use a Clamp or Bias/Gain device afterwards to lower the Pyramids' output.
