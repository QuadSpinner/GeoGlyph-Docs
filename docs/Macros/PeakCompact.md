Based on KillSpike's lossless code and PeakDetect's altitude-agnostic masking, PeakCompact can compact and smooth unrealistic spiny peaks and transform them into believable mountain spires. This convenient device works with individual peaks as well as entire ridges. PeakCompact can be masked for explicit processing.
