# EarthSpine

##### Macro :: Generator

EarthSpine is a powerful generator for creating scenic mountain ranges or rolling hills. The gentle rock and sedimentary flows are generated from the fractal itself, not by modifiers. The slopes and grooves are extremely conducive to erosion, in particular with GeoGlyph's NeoFlow macro.

- A powerful generator for creating mountains ranges or rolling hills
- Gentle rock and sedimentary flows are born in the fractal itself and not through modifiers like Erosion.
- The slopes and grooves are extremely favorable for erosion, especially with NeoFlow 
- Lightning fast even at high resolution
- Does not use erosion. Results are from pure fractal mathematics.
