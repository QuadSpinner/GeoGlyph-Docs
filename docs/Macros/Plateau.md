# Plateau

##### Macro :: Processing

Plateau is a robust large-scale terrain generator. This macro takes a Layout-drawn shape and converts it into a realistic plateau, with enough detail and erosion to combine with World Machine generators (eg. Voronoi and Perlin), or GeoGlyph generators (eg. Perlinoi and Perlinox). Plateau output can be eroded on its own to create Hero terrains, or combined with other dynamic GeoGlyph devices, such as Crater and Peak.
