A different take on the stock-standard Perlin fractal, StrataPerlin is a very powerful 'ground fractal' that can be used on its own or layered with other generators. The Perlinesque output is stratified with pattern-matching formulae to generate realistic slabs of minerals ready for erosion. This device is extremely fast to build, even at ultra-high resolutions.
