The choice macro for realistic, large scale dunes. DunesSea gives you that sequential distribution, found in iconic deserts, such as the Sahara and Gobi. You can choose the direction of the dune modulation, as well as the overall direction of the dunes' drift. You can even bend the dunes around rock formations or other imposing terrains by adding an optional influence mask.
