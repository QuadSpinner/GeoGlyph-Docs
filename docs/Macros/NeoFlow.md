NeoFlow is a brand new form of erosion that builds on WM's existing erosion prowess. Eliminating that familiar eroded look, NeoFlow transforms the deep vertical flow lines that occur on hard surfaces when using WM's default erosion, into softer, more random flow patterns.

Great for expansive slopes, NeoFlow maintains the form of the terrain, even with aggressive erosion. And NeoFlow is very easy to use. The macro's smart logic enables you to control flow roughness, depth, and erosion strength with a few simple settings.

D: Need to rename 'Enigma Properties' (below) to NeoFlow

- A new form of erosion for World Machine that builds on top of WM's existing erosion powers
- Avoids the "typical" World Machine eroded look
- Great for expansive slopes
- Does not suffer from the strong perpendicular flow lines that occur with World Machine's default erosion on hard surfaces
- Keeps the form of the terrain intact even at strong erosion levels
- Extremely easy to use in comparison: control flow roughness, depth, and erosion strength with simple settings - GeoGlyph will figure out the rest for you
