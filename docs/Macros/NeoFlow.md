NeoFlow is a brand new form of erosion that builds on WM's existing erosion prowess. Eliminating that familiar eroded look, NeoFlow transforms the deep vertical flow lines that occur on hard surfaces when using WM's default erosion, into softer, more random flow patterns.

Great for expansive slopes, NeoFlow maintains the form of the terrain, even with aggressive erosion. And NeoFlow is very easy to use. The macro's smart logic enables you to control flow roughness, depth, and erosion strength with a few simple settings.
