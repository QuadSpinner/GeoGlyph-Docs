Using erosion data, OverErosion extrapolates how additional erosion will affect the terrain. Built-in lossless modifiers highlight intricate erosion details, without further eroding or re-eroding the terrain, thereby preserving its original shape. And you maintain control of the process. 

## Properties
 
### OverErosion 
- **Erosion**: Intensity of the erosion flow.
- **Sensitivity**: Controls the soil's flow-sensitivity towards fluvial erosion.
- **Soft Soil**: Concentration of fluvial soft soil.
### Altitude 
- **Maximum**: The maximum limit within which the processing takes place.
- **Minimum**: The minimum limit within which the processing takes place.
- **Transition**: Smooths the falloff of the effect beyond the limit.
