A hybrid fractal, Perlinoi is generated by combining the algorithms of the standard Voronoi fractal with the naturalistic roughness capabilities of the Perlin fractal. It allows you to create your favorite Voronoi patterns while adding controllable amounts of noise and roughness to the output. Depending on your erosion needs, you can choose Simple or Complex output for precise control. 

## Properties
- **Input**: None
- **Output**: Heightfield - Main output
- **[Perlinoi]**: 
- **Scale**: Scale of the fractal
- **Style**: Voronoi-based cell structure
- **Shape**: Shape bias for Voronoi cells
- **Seed**: Random seed.
- **Output**: Choose Simple Output for basic shapes that you will add to later. Choose Complex Output for a sophisticated heightfield ready to be eroded.
