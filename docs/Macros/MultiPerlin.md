An essential building block, MultiPerlin enhances your collection of basic fractals. This macro elaborates on WM's classic implementation of the Perlin fractal and adds multiple recursions to create exquisite complex rocky formations.

MultiPerlin provides 3 levels of output, with 3 times the complexity that you can control for a Perlin noise, and yet is extremely fast to build.
