An essential building block, MultiPerlin enhances your collection of basic fractals. This macro elaborates on WM's classic implementation of the Perlin fractal and adds multiple recursions to create exquisite complex rocky formations.

MultiPerlin provides 3 levels of output, with 3 times the complexity that you can control for a Perlin noise, and yet is extremely fast to build.

- A great building block, MultiPerlin augments your collection of basic fractals.
- It builds on top of the World Machine's great implementation of the Perlin fractal and adds further recursions to create complex rocky formations
- MultiPerlin provides three levels of output, with triple the level of complexity that you can control for a Perlin noise
- Extremely fast to build
