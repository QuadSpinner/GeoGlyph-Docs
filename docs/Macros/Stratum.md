A new approach to the terracing and stratification of convex terrains that is extremely fast. Stratum creates variable levels of stratification with smooth, flat top surfaces that do not appear featureless and void. Many of the original formations are retained as indentations in the flat area.Unlike other terracing methods, Stratum can embellish flat terraces by creating a “lip” along the edge as well as an incline inward from the edge.
