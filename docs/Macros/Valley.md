Valley works like @Plateau, but rather than raise mountains, it carves exquisite valleys out of Layout-drawn shapes and heightfields. Sensitive to weathering, the generated terrain provides essential erosion out of the box. You can control sedimentary flows, valley aging, feature scale, roughness, and more. Valley output can also be combined with other generators or eroded alone.
