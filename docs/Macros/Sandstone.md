A powerful debut device, Sandstone can create a Grand Canyon style environment from any input. Even a simple Perlin fractal can be transformed into a beautiful and dramatic setting with strong flows, stratified sandstone formations, and unique color patterns.A built-in specialized version of our HeightFrag macro provides you with an automatic color map that can be applied to the terrain. The map can be modified to suit your needs. If you prefer to build your own color map, you can also consume the raw HeightFrag output for further processing.
