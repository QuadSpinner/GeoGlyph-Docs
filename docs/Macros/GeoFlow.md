# GeoFlow

##### Macro :: Processing

Utilizing the flow data of an eroded heightfield, this premium device redistributes the erosion to create a realistic, atypical terrain. Multiple GeoFlow modifiers can be used with specific masks on the main heightfield for even greater realism. 
You can achieve different results by blending Flow and Deposition data or by using Deposition or Wear data instead of Flow.

## Properties
- **Input**: Heightfield - any heightfield
- **Mask (Optional)**: - heightfield or bitmap to be used as a mask
- **Output**: Heightfield - main output
- **[GeoFlow]**: 
- **Strength**: Strength of the reflowed erosion.
- **Bias**: Directional bias for the flow.
- **Depth**: Depth of the flow channels.
