# Avalanche

##### Macro :: Processing

Avalanche creates realistic snowbanks, snow accumulation, and melt. It can also transform a terrain into a desolate snowfield. Avalanche deforms the terrain during processing, just like the weathering and/or build-up from snow that occurs in nature, yet preserves the terrain's overall shape and feel. 

This super macro has a lightweight version of Blizzard built in which allows you to manage the direction and verticality of the snowfall. For even greater control, Avalanche provides explicit masks to recombine the output with the original terrain and to create snow material masks.
