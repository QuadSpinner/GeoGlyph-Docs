For a vast rocky desert with plateaus, valleys, distinct rock formations, and stratification, HighDesert is ideal. This macro can generate an exacting degree of detail. As you increase the scale of the fractal, the shapes adapt and the level of detail multiplies.

- Rocky desert with plateaus, valleys, strong rock formations, stratification and more
- Shapes adapt and produce more detail as you increase the scale of the fractal
- Lightning fast even at high resolution
- Does not use erosion. Results are from pure fractal mathematics.
