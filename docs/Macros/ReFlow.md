ReFlow uses blunt erosion tactics to force basic Flow and Deposition maps out of any existing heightfield. It does not require the original erosion data. ReFlow is very useful for generating erosion maps without modifying the terrain. ReFlow can be used on any heightfield, including geological satellite data, such as DEM files.

## Properties
- **Input**: Heightfield - Any heightfield
- **Output**: Heightfield - Flow
- **Output**: Heightfield - Wear
- **Output**: Heightfield - Deposit
- **Output**: Heightfield - NaturalFlow
- **Output**: Heightfield - NaturalWear
- **Output**: Heightfield - NaturalDeposit
- **Output**: Heightfield - Crevices
- **[ReFlow]**: 
- **Regeneration**: Amount of regeneration
- **Intensity**: Accentuate flow shapes
- **Soil Quality****: Governs the regeneration quality based on soil type. The most accurate soil type will create the most accurate flows.
