EcoBumps is a unique solution for creating large aerial-view forests and jungles. This macro produces bumps that resemble tree tops and look very realistic when applied on an appropriate material. This simple device can save you a lot of render time by avoiding instancing and ecosystems that usually factor into hundreds of billions of polygons.
