SnowDrift creates realistic snowbanks, snow accumulation, and melt. It can also transform a terrain into a desolate snowfield. SnowDrift deforms the terrain during processing, just like the weathering from snow that occurs in nature.For even greater control, SnowDrift provides explicit masks to recombine the output with the original terrain.
