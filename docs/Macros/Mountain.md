The flagship of GeoGlyph, Mountain produces rugged mountains from pure fractals. The characteristic hard edges and realistic flat slopes are not seen in WM. 

Mountain's complex generation is achieved through a few simple controls and renders at lightning fast speed. Superb erosion can be achieved with GeoGlyph's NeoFlow. The results are breathtakingly dramatic.
