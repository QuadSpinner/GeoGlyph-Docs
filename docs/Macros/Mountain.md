The flagship of GeoGlyph, Mountain produces rugged mountains from pure fractals. The characteristic hard edges and realistic flat slopes are not seen in WM. 

Mountain's complex generation is achieved through a few simple controls and renders at lightning fast speed. Superb erosion can be achieved with GeoGlyph's NeoFlow. The results are breathtakingly dramatic. 

- The flagship of GeoGlyph, Mountain creates rugged mountains from pure fractals
- Hard edges and realistic flat slopes that are not seen in World Machine
- Complex generation through a few simple controls
- Superb erosion possible when combined with NeoFlow (WM erosion will not work completely with this macro ----- C, we can exclude this last bit if you think it is not wise to say it)
- Lightning fast even at high resolution
- Does not use erosion. Results are from pure fractal mathematics.
