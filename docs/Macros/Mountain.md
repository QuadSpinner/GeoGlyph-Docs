# Mountain

##### Macro :: Generator

The flagship of GeoGlyph, Mountain produces rugged mountains from pure fractals. The characteristic hard edges and realistic flat slopes are not seen in WM. 

Mountain's complex generation is achieved through a few simple controls and renders at lightning fast speed. Superb erosion can be achieved with GeoGlyph's NeoFlow. The results are breathtakingly dramatic. 

- The flagship of GeoGlyph, Mountain creates rugged mountains from pure fractals
- Hard edges and realistic flat slopes that are not seen in World Machine
- Complex generation through a few simple controls
- Superb erosion possible when combined with NeoFlow (WM erosion will not work completely with this macro ----- C, we can exclude this last bit if you think it is not wise to say it)
- Lightning fast even at high resolution
- Does not use erosion. Results are from pure fractal mathematics.
