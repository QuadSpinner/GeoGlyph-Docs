The Dunes generator produces exquisite, sensual dunes with soft, undulating lines, as well as sharp wind-defined edges. You can easily control the overall scale of the dunes and the general flow direction. 
Specifically built for dramatic ground-level shots, Dunes offers visual opportunities that may not be attainable with systematic dunes.
