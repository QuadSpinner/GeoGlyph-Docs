# NaturalTerrace

##### Macro :: Processing

FIX SUB-TERRACES -> SUBTERRACESNaturalTerrace takes a very different approach from the typically uniform terracing and stratification devices. It follows natural properties, such as slope and collapsible locations along the input terrain, and creates non-uniform terraces and stratified layers in just those areas. The terraces merge seamlessly with the non-terraced portions of the terrain. An optional terrace mask output makes it extremely easy to create sophisticated textures and to erode the terrain without affecting the terraces. 

## Properties
- **Input**: Heightfield - any heightfield
- **Tilt Coordinates**: - X/Y coordinates where tilt should begin
- **Mask (Optional)**: - heightfield or bitmap to be used as a mask
- **Output**: 
- **[Terrace]**: 
- **Terraces**: Quantity of terraces.
- **Sub-Terraces**: Quantity of subterraces.
- **Dip**: Degree of the dip in between layers
- **Direction**: Direction of the terracing.
- **[Influences]**: 
- **Slope Maximum**: Maximum degree of slope.
- **Slope Minimum**: Minimum degree of slope.
- **Tilt Bias**: Direction bias for tilting the terraces.
