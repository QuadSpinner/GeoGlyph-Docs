PerlinRiver was designed to create close-up environments of a winding river, that can range from rapids to a gentle stream.The terrain surrounding the river flow is shaped to support sandy banks, rocks, or vegetation. This super-fast generator works especially well with GeoGlyph's Stones macros (@StonesSimplex, @StonesComplex, @StonesCortex).
