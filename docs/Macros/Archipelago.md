Generate an entire archipelago with just one robust device and achieve that â€˜shattered islands' look. Archipelago gives you full control over scale, coastal vs. central island bias, sprawl of the main body, and optional built-in erosion. You can also opt to utilize a user-drawn Layout as the shape guide, instead of the built-in fractal.The terrains can be further enhanced by adding a circling reef to create individual atolls or a cluster of reef-fringed isles. Scenic and spectacular!

## Properties
 
### Archipelago 

- **Sprawl**: Adjusts the intensity or coverage of the sprawl.
- **Stratification**: Assigns the quantity of strata. 
- **Smoothing**: A simple way to smooth the entire archipelago. Very useful for distant terrains or if you are getting unnecessary noise.
- **Island-Coast Ratio**: Control the bias between multiple islands and coastal terrain.
- **Reef Formation**: Amount of reef formation on the fringe of the terrain.

### Processing 

- **Scale**: Scale of the geological features on the isles.
- **Warp**: Amount of warping for geological features, including island formation.
- **Detail**: Level of detail in the geological features
- **Coastal Erosion**: Amount of pre-defined coastal erosion to be applied to the output. Use zero if you wish to use your own coastal erosion separately.
- **Seed**: 
- **Shelf**: 
- **Fragmentation**:
