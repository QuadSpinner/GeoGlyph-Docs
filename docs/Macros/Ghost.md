Breaking away from the signature World Machine shapes, Ghost distorts terrains and adds new distinctive features to the heightfield. This distortion produces dramatic erosion that feels more natural. It also stimulates varying erosion flows, different from the perpendicular flows that can give your terrains a familiar look.
