## Toolbar and Toolbox
GeoGlyph provides a modern interface for finding, using, and organzing your devices and macros. The Toolbar replaces the standard World Machine tabbed toolbar in both IDE and Hosted modes. The Toolbox is available as both a popup and a permanent sidebar.

## Toolbar and Search
The GeoGlyph Enhanced Toolbar provides a fast and easy to use Search feature. Instead of pouring through several tabs to find the device or macro you require, just enter the name (or even a part of the name) in the search field. You will be instantly presented with all available options.

The search feature works across all macros and devices, including GeoGlyph 1, GeoGlyph 2, and any custom macros you may have added to the World Machine Macros folder. See the *Macros* section below for additional information.

## Toolbox Popup and Sidebar
The Toolbox is available both as a popup and as a sidebar for your convenience. If you prefer to have a permanent sidebar while you work, you can click the "Toggle Toolbox Sidebar" button in the GeoGlyph IDE's right toolbar. This will dock the Sidebar to the right side of the interface.

If you prefer a more streamlined experience, you can use the large popup button in the left part of the Toolbar to open the Toolbox as a popup. It will hide itself after use.

## Managing Favorites
Using Favorites is a simple process.

To add a favorite: Go to any tab, hold down the Ctrl key, and click a device or macro to add it to the Favorites toolbar.
To remove a favorite: Hold down the Ctrl key, and click the device or macro in the Favorites toolbar to remove it.

## Macros
Macros are available directly from the Macros tab of the Toolbar, and are sorted by folders in the Toolbox's Macros tab.

If a macro is modified, added, or removed in the Macros folder, GeoGlyph will show a "Rescan Macros" button in the status bar. Click that button to have GeoGlyph scan World Machine for the changes. It is recommended that macros are not used until a Rescan has been performed, otherwise the wrong macro version could be used.
