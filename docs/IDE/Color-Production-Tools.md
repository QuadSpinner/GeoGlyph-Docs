## Color Production
GeoGlyph 2 takes a sophisticated approach to the color production. With @GeoColor you can create texture maps by using a photograph or concept art as a color source. Primitive Components and Texture Macros create texture masks that can be used to power @GeoColor or the Colorizer device.

## GeoColor
One of the most powerful new offerings in GeoGlyph 2 is GeoColor. This advanced gradient toolkit can create terrain textures from a photograph with a single click.

GeoColor can learn color patterns from a photograph, then allows you to pre- and post-process color gradients generated from the image. A modern gradient editor provides minute control over every aspect of the coloration process, while post-production effects provide realistic scattering and diffusion for the final texture.

For detailed information on each GeoColor setting, see @GeoColor.

## Primitive Components
Primitive Components provide individual grayscale texture components that must be combined either with other primitives, or with Texture Macros to produce sophisticated texture masks.

- @Surfacer
- @RidgeLine 

## Texture Macros
Texture Macros create complete grayscale maps for color distribution. 

- @GeoShape
- @RealColor
- @HeightFrag
- @SimpleTexture
