## Color Production
One of the most powerful new offerings in GeoGlyph 2 is GeoColor. This advanced gradient toolkit can create terrain textures from a photograph with a single click.

GeoColor can learn color patterns from a photograph, then allows you to pre- and post-process color gradients generated from the image. A modern gradient editor provides minute control over every aspect of the coloration process, while post-production effects provide realistic scattering and diffusion for the final texture.

For detailed information on each GeoColor setting, see @GeoColor.
