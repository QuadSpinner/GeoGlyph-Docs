> WIP Recorder is a feature which allows you to take screenshots of your work at regular intervals in GeoGlyph. You simply need to provide the path to save the screenshot files and the time interval at which the screenshots should be taken. This feature helps you see the progress of your work and you can monitor the flow through which your project went.

> There are two ways to use WIP Recorder:
- Using **Start/Stop WIP Recorder** in GeoGlyph menu item. Clicking once will start WIP Recorder and clicking on it again will pause it. You can again resume taking screenshots by clicking on it.
- Using **Toggle WIP Recorder** in the GeoGlyph Toolbox on top right. Toggling on this button will start WIP Recorder and toggling off will pause the WIP Recorder.

### WIP Recorder options dialog
> This dialog lets you set options for WIP Recorder

### Path
> GeoGlyph has a path set for you to save the screenshot files when you turn on the WIP Recorder feature. You can change the path by using this option.

### Interval
> This option lets you set the interval (in seconds) at which the WIP recorder takes screenshot of the :warning: work area :warning:. By changing this slider value you can preview how many average screenshot files will be created or how many average seconds worth of video can be generated from the screenshot files. It also lets you preview the approximate disk size that will be used if that value is used.
