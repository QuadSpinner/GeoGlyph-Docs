## A new start experience
Instead of opening up to the default document, GeoGlyph uses a new Start Screen which gives you options on how you would like to begin your experience.

You can choose between the IDE and Hosted Mode, and select which version of World Machine to use. You can also choose to open a recent file, or one of the several examples we provide to learn GeoGlyph.

## Choose your experience
Select "GeoGlyph IDE" to launch the IDE with the selected version of World Machine. The IDE will then start World Machine and embed itself in it.

Select "World Machine" to use the Hosted Mode which uses a lightweight version of the IDE tools - specifically the [Toolbox](IDE--Toolbox) and toolbar, as well as the [Enhanced Device Editor](IDE--Device-Editor) while allowing you to use the traditional World Machine interface.

[!NOTE]
You can use World Machine directly, without using the IDE in any form. However, the Enhanced Device Editor, which is necessary for tools such as @GeoColor. Nor will Pro tools such as the Build Stack, Toolbox, and other IDE enhancements.
[NOTE!]

## Quick access to recent files
The Recent tab shows the last 10 files accessed with GeoGlyph. If you have used the [Build and Stack](IDE--Build-Stack) option to build the file before, the latest screenshot of that build will be shown in the thumbnail when you select a file.

You can also choose *OPEN FILE...* to open any file. This will launch the GeoGlyph IDE by default, using the selected version of World Machine.

[!NOTE]
This list is separate from World Machine's *recently used* files list.

## Examples
The Examples tab lets you browse through and open any of the number of example files installed with GeoGlyph. Example files specific to GeoGlyph 2.0 functionality are highlighted in purple.

Double-click a file to open it with the selected version of World Machine in GeoGlyph IDE mode.

## Updates, News, and Critical Warnings
Information about [Updates](Getting-Started--Updates) and critical news will be shown at the bottom of the start screen. We highly recommend updating the latest version when one is made available.

All updates to GeoGlyph 2.0 are free. Please see the release notes for each update for pertinent information.
