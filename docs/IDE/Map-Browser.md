## The Maps
The Map Browser is a very simple library that contains the presets that ship with GeoGlyph, as well as any custom presets you save in the @GeoColor dialog.

## Managing Favorites
Using Favorites is a simple process.

To ADD a favorite: Hold down the `Ctrl` key, and click a gradient to add it to the Favorites view.
To REMOVE a favorite: Hold down the `Ctrl` key, and click a gradient in the Favorites view to remove it.

[!WARNING]
KNOWN BUG: If you are using the experimental Sidebar, and are unable to see the standard World Machine color maps in your dialog, turn off the ENHANCED INTERFACE from the top-right toolbar of the GeoGlyph window. Then click the terrain colors button. This will bring up the traditional dialog. You can switch on the ENHANCED INTERFACE once you have made your selection.
